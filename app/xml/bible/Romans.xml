    <verse num="1">Beloved, <crossref let="t" cid="c62004001.1"/>do not believe every spirit, but <crossref let="u" cid="c62004001.2"/>test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for <crossref let="v" cid="c62004001.3"/>many <crossref let="w" cid="c62004001.4"/>false prophets <crossref let="x" cid="c62004001.5"/>have gone out into the world.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004002"/>
    <verse num="2">By this you know the Spirit of God: <crossref let="y" cid="c62004002.1"/>every spirit that confesses that <crossref let="z" cid="c62004002.2"/>Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004003"/>
    <verse num="3">and every spirit <crossref let="a" cid="c62004003.1"/>that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and <crossref let="b" cid="c62004003.2"/>now is in the world already.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004004"/>
    <verse num="4">Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for <crossref let="c" cid="c62004004.1"/>he who is in you is greater than <crossref let="d" cid="c62004004.2"/>he who is in the world.</verse>

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004006"/>
    <verse num="6">We are from God. <crossref let="g" cid="c62004006.1"/>Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know <crossref let="h" cid="c62004006.2"/>the Spirit of truth and <crossref let="i" cid="c62004006.3"/>the spirit of error.</verse>

    <heading>God Is Love</heading>
    <begin-paragraph/>
    <verse num="7">Beloved, <crossref let="j" cid="c62004007.1"/>let us love one another, for love is from God, and <crossref let="k" cid="c62004007.2"/>whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004008"/>
    <verse num="8"><crossref let="l" cid="c62004008.1"/>Anyone who does not love does not know God, because <crossref let="m" cid="c62004008.2"/>God is love.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004009"/>
    <verse num="9">In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that <crossref let="n" cid="c62004009.1"/>God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004010"/>
    <verse num="10">In this is love, <crossref let="o" cid="c62004010.1"/>not that we have loved God <crossref let="n" cid="c62004010.2"/>but that he loved us and sent his Son to be <crossref let="p" cid="c62004010.3"/>the propitiation for our sins.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004011"/>
    <verse num="11">Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004012"/>
    <verse num="12"><crossref let="q" cid="c62004012.1"/>No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and <crossref let="r" cid="c62004012.2"/>his love is perfected in us.</verse>

    <begin-paragraph/>
    <verse num="13"><crossref let="s" cid="c62004013.1"/>By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004014"/>
    <verse num="14">And <crossref let="t" cid="c62004014.1"/>we have seen and testify that <crossref let="u" cid="c62004014.2"/>the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of <crossref let="v" cid="c62004014.3"/>the world.</verse>

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004016"/>
    <verse num="16">So <crossref let="x" cid="c62004016.1"/>we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. <crossref let="y" cid="c62004016.2"/>God is love, and <crossref let="z" cid="c62004016.3"/>whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.</verse>

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004018"/>
    <verse num="18">There is no fear in love, but <crossref let="d" cid="c62004018.1"/>perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not <crossref let="a" cid="c62004018.2"/>been perfected in love.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v62004019"/>
    <verse num="19"><crossref let="e" cid="c62004019.1"/>We love because he first loved us.</verse>
